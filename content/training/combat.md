If you've chosen a path that involves fighting other ships, here are some
skills you'll probably want to train:

`Weapon Upgrades` Level IV allows you to use the tech 2 versions of
the damage bonus modules: Heat Sink II for lasers, Ballistic Control System
II for missiles, Magnetic Field Stabilizer II for hybrid weapons, Gyrostabilizer
II for projectile weapons, and Drone Damage Amplifier II for drones. Better
modules means more damage means faster ISK.

If your ships have drone bays, you'll also want to further train your drone skills.
`Light Drone Operation` Level IV is a good investment as the increased drone
damage will benefit any ship with a drone bay. Eventually you will want to train
the other drone support skills as well to improve the performance of your drones
even further.

If the path you've chosen involves upgrading to higher classes of ships, you'll
probably also want to start training towards medium-sized weapons.
