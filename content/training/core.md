There are some skills that basically every player will want to train
because they're useful no matter what ship you're flying.

`Hull Upgrades` Level IV allows you to use the better Damage Control II
module, which is a significant improvement over the basic version of the module,
making your ship more survivable.

`Shield Upgrades IV` allows you to use better shield-related modules, improving
your shield-based defenses. (Caldari, Gallente, and Minmatar only. If you're
using ships that focus on armor defenses, you can skip this for now.)

If the ships you're flying have drone bays, `Drones` Level III and
`Light Drone Operation` Level I are highly recommended so that your ships
can use at least light combat drones, which provide some additional combat
capability for any ship with a drone bay. If you decide to keep using
drones you'll eventually want to train `Drones` Level V so that you
can launch up to 5 drones (assuming the ship allows it).
