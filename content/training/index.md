Now that you have a better sense of what you're interested in doing in EVE,
it's time to adjust your skill queue to train the skills that will help you
with your chosen activities.

### Combat Skills

If you've chosen a path that involves fighting other ships, here are some
skills you'll probably want to train:

`Weapon Upgrades` Level IV allows you to use the tech 2 versions of
the damage bonus modules: Heat Sink II for lasers, Ballistic Control System
II for missiles, Magnetic Field Stabilizer II for hybrid weapons, and Gyrostabilizer
II for projectile weapons. Better modules means more damage means faster ISK.

`Hull Upgrades` Level IV allows you to use the better Damage Control II
module, which is a significant improvement over the basic version of the module,
making your ship more survivable.

`Shield Upgrades IV` allows you to use better shield-related modules, improving
your shield-based defenses. (Caldari, Gallente, and Minmatar only. If you're
using ships that focus on armor defenses, you can skip this for now.)

If the path you've chosen involves upgrading to higher classes of ships, you'll
probably also want to start training towards medium-sized weapons.

### Ship Skills

Nearly everyone will want to train their race's Frigate skill up to at least
Level III, as this both improves the effectiveness of their frigate's ship bonuses
and also unlocks additional classes of ships for training.

If the path you've chosen involves flying frigates a lot, you'll probably want
to go a bit further and train the skill to Level IV to further improve your
ship bonuses.

If the path you've chosen involves upgrading to higher classes of ships, you'll
probably want to start training towards cruisers.

### Exploration Skills

If you've chosen to try out exploration further, you'll want to train the following:

`Astrometric Acquisition` and `Astrometric Rangefinding` make it easier to
scan down cosmic signatures. You'll want to train them both to Level II.

`Archeology` increases your Virus Coherence ("health") when hacking relic
site containers. Training this to Level III will help you successfully
complete hacks more often. `Hacking` is the equivalent for data sites,
but it's less of a priority since relic sites are the better of the two.

Also make sure to train your racial Frigate skill all the way to Level IV,
as that will increase the effectiveness of your exploration ship's bonuses.

### Trade Skills

If you've chosen a path that involves lots of buying and selling things on
the market, you'll want to improve your trading skills. You can skip these
skills if chosing a path that doesn't focus on the market.

`Trade` Level III will maximize the number of simultaneous buy and sell orders
you can have posted on the market at once as an alpha clone.

`Broker Relations` Level II will slightly reduce the fees involved in creating
market orders. It's a small difference, but over time that can add up to a lot
of ISK.
