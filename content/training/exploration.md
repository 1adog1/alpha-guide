If you've chosen to try out exploration further, you'll want to train the following:

`Astrometric Acquisition` and `Astrometric Rangefinding` make it easier to
scan down cosmic signatures. You'll want to train them both to Level II.

`Archeology` increases your Virus Coherence ("health") when hacking relic
site containers. Training this to Level III will help you successfully
complete hacks more often. `Hacking` is the equivalent for data sites,
but it's less of a priority since relic sites are the better of the two.

Also make sure to train your racial Frigate skill all the way to Level IV,
as that will increase the effectiveness of your exploration ship's bonuses.
