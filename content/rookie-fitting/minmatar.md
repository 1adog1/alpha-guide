### Weapons

Rookie ships (corvettes) use weapons from the 'small' size bracket.
This fit uses two `125mm Gatling AutoCannon I` turrets in the high slots.
Autocannons are shorter ranged but faster firing than artillery.
Because you're generally going to be fighting things at close range
in a rookie ship, using a shorter-ranged weapon system is fine.

The autocannons are loaded with 200 `Fusion S` each, but you should carry at least 2000
extra ammo in your cargo hold to make sure you don't run out while fighting.

Fusion is one of the shorter-ranged projectile ammo types, but does more explosive damage.
Since you're going to be fighting a close range anyway, more damage is good.

The `Gyrostabilizer I` in one of the low slots boosts your projectile turrets, increasing
their damage per shot, rate of fire, and tracking speed (making it easier to hit targets).

### Defenses

Since the Reaper is bonused for shield boosters, this fit is based around shields. It uses a
`Small Shield Booster I` in one of the mid slots. (A medium shield booster could fit, but it
uses much more capacitor for each cycle, which on a rookie ship will quickly run out.)

The fit also uses a `Damage Control I` in one of its low slots, which increases the ship's
resistances, reducing incoming damage and making the shield booster more effective.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

### Where do I get this stuff?

You may already have some of these modules, but if you don't, it's time to go use the Market.
The next chapter will walk you through how to effectively use the market to purchase items.
