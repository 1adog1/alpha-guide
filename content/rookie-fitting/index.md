Now that you're done with the tutorial (and probably just got your ship blown up),
you might be wondering what to do next.

Don't panic!

The easiest ship to get your hands on is your own race's corvette (typically known
as a "rookie ship"). You get one for free if you don't have any other ships in the
station you're in. In fact, you probably already have one if you docked up after
exploding.

You can significantly improve the effectiveness of your rookie ship by properly fitting
it with modules bought from the market. Select your race below to see a suggested fit
for your racial rookie ship that you can use without having to train more skills.

{{% notice info %}}
We recommend you use some of the skill points from the Mini Skill Injector
used in the tutorial to train the skills `Drones` III and `Light Drone Operation` I.
This will allow you to use a Combat Drone in your corvette.
You will need to purchase a skillbook from the Market to train Light Drone Operation.
