In addition to the introductory tutorial, there are also a handful of Career Agents
which will provide you with various missions introducing you to a particular kind of
gameplay. These missions are an excellent way to explore some of the possibilities in
EVE while also acquiring some extra ISK and ship hulls.

We recommend that you complete all of the career agent mission chains now. The pages in
this section will provide brief descriptions of what each chain will teach you and the
rewards you will receive for completing them.
