This mission chain is **Balancing the Books**. Its 10 missions will have you doing
salvaging, hacking, mining, and a bit of running around delivering things to agents
in different systems. These are ways that you can make money in EVE without having
to use your weapons.

If you get stuck, there's a video guide to the missions that begins
here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RtjAYs8spU

Since the video guide was made in 2015, the older interfaces may look a bit
different from what you see now, but the general steps to complete the mission
will be the same.

As you complete the chain, you'll earn a couple of new ships, some skill books,
some modules, and a good chunk of ISK.
