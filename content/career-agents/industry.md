This chain is **Making Mountains of Molehills**. Its 10 missions focus
on how to produce new items in EVE from scratch: mining raw materials
and then building modules, charges (ammo), and ships from those materials.

If you're having trouble figuring out how to use the industry interface,
you can watch the tutorial videos provided in-game. Press F12 to open the
"Help" window, then click the "Tutorial Videos" tab. Scroll down to the
"Industry" section and watch the "Manufacturing" video.

As you complete the chain, you'll earn a couple of new ships, some skill
books, some modules, and a good chunk of isk.

#### Common Stumbling Blocks

 * In mission 2 of 10, note that the Veldspar must be in the station's Item Hangar,
   not your ship's Cargo Hold, before it can be Reprocessed.
 * In mission 3 of 10, the `1MN Civilian Afterburner I Blueprint` must be purchased from the Market.
   It should cost 20,000 ISK.  See the [Use the Market](/market/) section if you're having trouble.
 * In mission 4 of 10, note that ore must be mined from the mission site to complete all mission objectives.
   Using ore mined from other asteroid belts, or previous mission steps, won't be enough to finish it.
 * In mission 9 of 10, make sure that you have both a mining laser and a weapon fit to your ship.
   Having only one or the other will be insufficient to complete the mission.
 * In mission 10 of 10, the minerals you will need come from a variety of different ores.
   See the [EVE University page on Asteroids and Ore](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Asteroids_and_Ore#Asteroid_distribution) for the locations of the appropriate ores.  Note that Zydrine cannot be obtained from high-security asteroids, except in randomly-spawning Ore anomalies.  It may be quickest and easiest to simply buy the rarer minerals from the Market.
