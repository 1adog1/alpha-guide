This chain is **Making Mountains of Molehills**. Its 10 missions focus
on how to produce new items in EVE from scratch: mining raw materials
and then building modules, charges (ammo), and ships from those materials.

If you're having trouble figuring out how to use the industry interface,
you can watch the tutorial videos provided in-game. Press F12 to open the
"Help" window, then click the "Tutorial Videos" tab. Scroll down to the
"Industry" section and watch the "Manufacturing" video.

As you complete the chain, you'll earn a couple of new ships, some skill
books, some modules, and a good chunk of isk.

#### Common Stumbling Blocks

 * In mission 1 of 10, note that the Veldspar must be mined from the mission site, 
   not mined from a regular asteroid belt or bought off the market.
 * In mission 2 of 10, note that the Veldspar must be in the station's Item Hangar,
   not your ship's Cargo Hold, before it can be Reprocessed.
 * In mission 4 of 10, note that you must warp to the destination given by your agent and destroy 
   the Rogue Drones found there to complete the mission, even if you already have sufficient Tritanium.
 * In mission 6 of 10, the minerals you will need come from a variety of different ores.
   See the [EVE University page on Asteroids and Ore](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Asteroids_and_Ore#Asteroid_distribution) for the locations of the appropriate ores.  If you cannot locate an appropriate system nearby bearing the needed ores,
   it may be quickest and easiest to simply buy the rarer minerals from the Market,
   or even to buy the needed Cap Booster 25s from the Market directly.
 * In mission 9 of 10, make sure that you have both a mining laser and a weapon fit to your ship.
   Having only one or the other will be insufficient to complete the mission. Also, to complete the mission
   you will need to loot the Production Assistant out of the cargo container (NOT the wreck) that spawns after
   destroying the second pirate.  If they are not showing up, try deactivating and re-engaging
   your mining laser(s).
 * In mission 10 of 10, the minerals you will need come from a variety of different ores (see the
   note on mission 6 of 10).  Note that Zydrine cannot be obtained from high-security asteroids,
   except in randomly-spawning Ore anomalies.  It may be quickest and easiest to simply buy
   the rarer minerals from the Market.  Alternately, you can buy the needed ship from the Market directly.
   You are also given a copy of the needed ship upon accepting Exploration career agent mission 2 of 5.
