This chain is **Making Mountains of Molehills**. Its 10 missions focus
on how to produce new items in EVE from scratch: mining raw materials
and then building modules, charges (ammo), and ships from those materials.

If you're having trouble figuring out how to use the industry interface,
you can watch the tutorial videos provided in-game. Press F12 to open the
"Help" window, then click the "Tutorial Videos" tab. Scroll down to the
"Industry" section and watch the "Manufacturing" video.

As you complete the chain, you'll earn a couple of new ships, some skill
books, some modules, and a good chunk of isk.
