There are actually two military career agents - the regular Military Agent and the Advanced Military Agent.
We recommend doing both chains - first the regular agent, then the advanced agent.

### Military Agent

The regular Military Agent focuses on teaching you the basics of PvE combat missions
in the chain **Cash Flow for Capsuleers**. Missions like these are one of the main
ways for making ISK in EVE via PvE combat.

If you get stuck along the way, there's a video guide to the missions that begins here:

Since the video guide was made in 2014, the older interfaces may look a bit different
from what you see now, but the general steps to complete the mission will be the same.

As you complete this chain, you'll earn a couple of new ships, some skill books, some
modules, and a good chunk of isk.

### Advanced Military Agent

The Advanced Military Agent focuses on teaching you some of the concepts typically
involved in PvP combat (though the agent's missions do not actually involve PvP).

We recommend following the [UniWiki Advanced Military chain guide]
(http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Advanced_Military_Career_Funnel_Chain) to complete
this mission chain.

As you complete this chain, you'll earn some new ships (including a Destroyer),
some skill books, some modules, and a decent chunk of ISK. At the end you'll also
be given a Letter item which you can use to join a Faction Warfare NPC corporation
if you decide that you want to take part in Faction Warfare. Don't rush off to do
that quite yet though.
