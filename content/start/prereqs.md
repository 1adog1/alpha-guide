This guide assumes that you have completed the initial tutorial in EVE Online, but haven't yet talked to any Career Agents.
**If you haven't finished the in-game tutorial yet, go do that first.**

Once you've finished the in-game tutorial you'll be ready to dive into [Fitting a Rookie Ship](/rookie-fitting/).
