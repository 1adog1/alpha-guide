### Searching the Market

When following this guide you'll almost always be wanting particular items
from the market. The fastest way to find those items is use the search box.
Copy the name of the item and paste it into the box to the left of the
"Search" button, then click that button. A list of results (most likely
with only a single item, but sometimes more) will appear beneath.
Click the item in the result list to see where that item is available.

### Buying Items

TODO: Describe how to interpret sell orders, how to pick which one to buy,
and how to buy it. Also mention how buying items may put them in another station.
