Over the course of your Career Agent missions, 
they will have given you some of the following ships.
They are more powerful than your rookie ship.
They are also more specialized, and each ship is built for a specific purpose.

### Frigates

##### Atron

The Atron is the Gallente fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules 
also makes it good at "tackling" enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Atron.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/atron/)

##### Tristan

The Tristan is the Gallente heavy attack frigate.
As a drone platform, it is unrivalled among tech one frigates,
capable of fielding a full flight of five light drones, with three spares
in its spacious drone bay.  It is also fairly well-rounded otherwise,
with moderate damage output from its turrets and decent speed and utility options.
However, it is somewhat lightly defended.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Tristan.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/tristan/)

##### Incursus

The Incursus is the Gallente heavy combat frigate.
Its bonuses to armor repairers let it shrug off a great deal of incoming damage, 
and it has good firepower and decent utility options.
However, it is fairly slow.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Incursus.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/incursus/)

##### Imicus

The Imicus is the Gallente exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Imicus.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/imicus/)

##### Navitas

The Navitas is the Gallente logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote armor repair modules,
allowing it to "heal" allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Navitas for now.

##### Maulus

The Maulus is the Gallente electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of sensor dampener modules,
allowing it to interfere with the locking speed and range of its enemies' sensors from long range.
However, it is extremely fragile, and is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Maulus for now.

##### Venture

The Venture is a mining frigate, not specific to any one empire.
It has powerful bonuses to its mining lasers and gas harvesters,
as well as a vast ore hold, allowing it to accumulate massive amounts of raw resources.
It also has innate resistance to warp disruption, allowing it to escape attackers more easily.
However, it is not particularly suitable for combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Venture.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/venture/)

### Destroyers

##### Catalyst

The Catalyst is one of the Gallente destroyers, focusing on hybrid turrets.
Boasting no fewer than eight hardpoints for hybrid weapons,
and with potent bonuses to their range and accuracy,
it will quickly destroy any enemies that come within range of its guns.
However, it is very slow, and relatively poorly defended,
as well as having very little utility outside of its lasers' damage output.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Catalyst.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/catalyst/)

### Industrials

##### Iteron

The Iteron is one of the Gallente industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place.
It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks
long enough for reinforcements to arrive.
However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Iteron.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/iteron/)

{{% notice warning %}}
Industrials are a favorite target of many players - and even in high-security space, where CONCORD will appear to punish illegal attacks, they will usually arrive *after* your attackers have reduced your ship to a flaming wreck.  Be mindful of your surroundings, and try to keep your cargo's value under about 50 million ISK.
