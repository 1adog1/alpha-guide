As exploration frigates are intended for exploration rather than combat, this ship is **unarmed**.
If you find yourself forced into combat, your best option is to simply run away.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Astrometric Rangefinding` Level II
* `Drones` Level IV
* `Light Drone Operation` Level I

The improved fit uses a Microwarpdrive rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run, 
and causes a large increase to your ship's signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
However, it provides a massively increased speed bonus.

You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position,
and disable it once you have arrived.
