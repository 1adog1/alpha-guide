{{% notice info %}}
This is a missile ship.  You will need to train at least **`Rockets` Level I** before you will be able to use its weapons.

Make sure that your launchers are loaded with `Scourge Rocket`,
as the Corax's damage bonus applies only to Kinetic damage.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Energy Grid Upgrades` Level III
