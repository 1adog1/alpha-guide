Over the course of your Career Agent missions, 
they will have given you some of the following ships.
They are more powerful than your rookie ship.
They are also more specialized, and each ship is built for a specific purpose.

### Frigates

##### Condor

The Condor is the Caldari fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules 
also makes it good at "tackling" enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Condor.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/condor/)

##### Kestrel

The Kestrel is the Caldari heavy attack frigate.
It gets substantial bonuses to its four missile launchers,
allowing it to deal substantial damage in close with rockets or lob light missiles from extreme range.
Its good number of midslots also allow it decent defenses or good utility.
However, it is somewhat slow.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Kestrel.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/kestrel/)

##### Merlin

The Merlin is the Caldari heavy combat frigate.
It has very powerful shields, and decent firepower and flexibility.
However, it is rather slow.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Merlin.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/merlin/)

##### Heron

The Heron is the Caldari exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Heron.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/heron/)

##### Bantam

The Bantam is the Caldari logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote shield booster modules,
allowing it to "heal" allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Bantam for now.

##### Griffin

The Griffin is the Caldari electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of ECM jammer modules,
allowing it to render enemies unable to lock targets 
and thus helpless to fight back against attackers.
However, it is extremely fragile and has little direct combat capability, 
and is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Griffin for now.

##### Venture

The Venture is a mining frigate, not specific to any one empire.
It has powerful bonuses to its mining lasers and gas harvesters,
as well as a vast ore hold, allowing it to accumulate massive amounts of raw resources.
It also has innate resistance to warp disruption, allowing it to escape attackers more easily.
However, it is not particularly suitable for combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Venture.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/venture/)

### Destroyers

##### Cormorant

The Cormorant is one of the Caldari destroyers, focusing on hybrid turrets.
Boasting seven hardpoints for hybrid weapons, with enhanced accuracy and
massive boosts to their range,
it can reach out and swat down enemies at long range with ease.
However, it is very slow compared to frigates, and its size makes it much easier to hit.
Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its weapons' damage output.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Cormorant.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/cormorant/)

### Industrials

##### Badger

The Badger is one of the Caldari industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place.
It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks
long enough for reinforcements to arrive.
However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Badger.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/badger/)

{{% notice warning %}}
Industrials are a favorite target of many players - and even in high-security space, where CONCORD will appear to punish illegal attacks, they will usually arrive *after* your attackers have reduced your ship to a flaming wreck.  Be mindful of your surroundings, and try to keep your cargo's value under about 20 million ISK.
