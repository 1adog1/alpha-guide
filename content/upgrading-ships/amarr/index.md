Over the course of your Career Agent missions, 
they will have given you some of the following ships.
They are more powerful than your rookie ship.
They are also more specialized, and each ship is built for a specific purpose.

### Frigate

##### Executioner

The Executioner is the Amarr fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules 
also makes it good at "tackling" enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Executioner.](/upgrading-ships/amarr/executioner/)

##### Tormentor

The Tormentor is the Amarr heavy attack frigate.
It gets substantial bonuses to its three energy turrets,
and is otherwise well-rounded, with decent defenses, 
sufficient midslots to offer some utility, and a moderate drone bay.
However, it is somewhat slow.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Tormentor.](/upgrading-ships/amarr/tormentor/)

##### Punisher

The Punisher is the Amarr heavy combat frigate.
It is incredibly durable, and has potent firepower.
However, it is quite slow, and its limited midslots limit its utility.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Punisher.](/upgrading-ships/amarr/punisher/)

##### Magnate

The Magnate is the Amarr exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Magnate.](/upgrading-ships/amarr/magnate/)

##### Inquisitor

The Inquisitor is the Amarr logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote armor repair modules,
allowing it to "heal" allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Inquisitor for now.

##### Crucifier

The Crucifier is the Amarr electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of weapon disruptor modules,
allowing it to degrade its enemies' range and accuracy while staying safely out of range itself.
However, it is extremely fragile, and is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Crucifier for now.

##### Venture

The Venture is a mining frigate, not specific to any one empire.
It has powerful bonuses to its mining lasers and gas harvesters,
as well as a vast ore hold, allowing it to accumulate massive amounts of raw resources.
It also has innate resistance to warp disruption, allowing it to escape attackers more easily.
However, it is not particularly suitable for combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Venture.](/upgrading-ships/amarr/venture/)

### Destroyer

##### Coercer

The Coercer is one of the Amarr destroyers, focusing on laser turrets.
Boasting no fewer than eight hardpoints for energy weapons,
and with potent bonuses to their range and accuracy,
it will quickly destroy any enemies that come near it.
However, it is very slow, and relatively poorly defended,
as well as having very little utility outside of its lasers' damage output.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Coercer.](/upgrading-ships/amarr/coercer/)

### Industrial

##### Sigil

The Sigil is one of the Amarr industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place.
It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks
long enough for reinforcements to arrive.
However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Sigil.](/upgrading-ships/amarr/sigil/)

{{% notice warning %}}
Industrials are a favorite target of many players - and even in high-security space, where CONCORD will appear to punish illegal attacks, they will usually arrive *after* your attackers have reduced your ship to a flaming wreck.  Be mindful of your surroundings, and as always, don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
