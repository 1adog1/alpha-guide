If you find yourself forced into combat, your best option is to simply run away.

{{% notice warning %}}
Industrials are a favorite target of many players - and even in high-security space, where CONCORD will appear to punish illegal attacks, they will usually arrive *after* your attackers have reduced your ship to a flaming wreck.  Be mindful of your surroundings, and try to keep your cargo's value under about 20 million ISK.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Shield Upgrades` Level IV
