{{% notice info %}}
This is a missile ship.  You will need to train at least **`Missile Launcher Operation` Level II**
and `Light Missiles` Level I before you will be able to use its weapons.

Make sure that your launchers are loaded with `Nova Light Missile`,
as the Talwar's damage bonus applies only to Explosive damage.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Shield Operation` Level III
* `Energy Grid Upgrades` Level III

The improved fit uses a Microwarpdrive rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run, but provides a massively increased speed bonus.. 
On most ships, it causes a large increase to your ship's signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
The Talwar receives a specific bonus to lessen this penalty, allowing it to use
the Microwarpdrive effectively to evade incoming shots.

You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position or enemy,
and disable it once you have arrived.  As your missiles have exceptional range,
you should usually be using your MWD to retreat to a safe distance from your target,
out of range of its return fire.
