## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Rockets` Level I
* `Shield Operation` Level III
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Drones` Level III
* `Light Drone Operation` Level I
