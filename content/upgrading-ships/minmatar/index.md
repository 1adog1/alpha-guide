Over the course of your Career Agent missions, 
they will have given you some of the following ships.
They are more powerful than your rookie ship.
They are also more specialized, and each ship is built for a specific purpose.

### Frigates

##### Slasher

The Slasher is the Minmatar fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules 
also makes it good at "tackling" enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Slasher.](/upgrading-ships/minmatar/slasher/)

##### Rifter

The Rifter is the Minmatar heavy attack frigate.
It gets substantial bonuses to its projectile turrets,
allowing it to deal good damage.  It is otherwise well-rounded,
with decent speed and defenses, and its slot layout allows it a high degree of flexibility.
However, that flexibility means it does not excel strongly in any one aspect.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Rifter.](/upgrading-ships/minmatar/rifter/)

##### Breacher

The Breacher is the Minmatar heavy combat frigate.
Its bonuses to shield boosters allow it to shrug off a great deal of incoming damage,
it can deal acceptable damage with its rocket launchers, and it has good speed.
However, its relatively weak powergrid can make it difficult to fit well.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Breacher.](/upgrading-ships/minmatar/breacher/)

##### Probe

The Probe is the Minmatar exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Probe.](/upgrading-ships/minmatar/probe/)

##### Burst

The Burst is the Minmatar logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote shield booster modules,
allowing it to "heal" allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Bantam for now.

##### Vigil

The Vigil is the Minmatar electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of target painter modules,
allowing it to render enemies substantially easier for its allies to hit.
However, it is extremely fragile and has little direct combat capability, 
and is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Vigil for now.

##### Venture

The Venture is a mining frigate, not specific to any one empire.
It has powerful bonuses to its mining lasers and gas harvesters,
as well as a vast ore hold, allowing it to accumulate massive amounts of raw resources.
It also has innate resistance to warp disruption, allowing it to escape attackers more easily.
However, it is not particularly suitable for combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Venture.](/upgrading-ships/minmatar/venture/)

### Destroyers

##### Thrasher

The Thrasher is one of the Minmatar destroyers, focusing on projectile turrets.
Boasting seven hardpoints for projectile weapons, with enhanced accuracy, damage and range,
it has a powerful offensive punch.
However, it is slower than frigates, and its size makes it much easier to hit.
Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its weapons' damage output.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Thrasher.](/upgrading-ships/minmatar/thrasher/)

### Industrials

##### Wreathe

The Wreathe is one of the Minmatar industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place.
It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks
long enough for reinforcements to arrive.
However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Wreathe.](/upgrading-ships/minmatar/wreathe/)

{{% notice warning %}}
Industrials are a favorite target of many players - and even in high-security space, where CONCORD will appear to punish illegal attacks, they will usually arrive *after* your attackers have reduced your ship to a flaming wreck.  Be mindful of your surroundings, and try to keep your cargo's value under about 20 million ISK.
