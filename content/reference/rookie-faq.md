_A list of questions frequently asked in the Rookie Help channel
and their associated answers._

#### Where is the Mini Skill Injector?
Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Y</kbd> to open the Redeem window. It should be in there.

#### I closed the Career Agents list, how do I get it back?
Press <kbd>F12</kbd> to open the 'Help' window, then click 'Show Career Agents'.

#### I bought something but it's not in my item hangar. Where is it?
Chances are you purchased an item listed from another station. Press
<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>T</kbd> to open the Assets window and figure out which station
you bought it in, then fly to that station to pick it up. Purchasing an item does
not magically move it to your current station.

#### How can I find which station one of my items is in?
Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>T</kbd> to open the Assets window which lists all of your assets
by station. Note that the assets window only updates once every ~5 minutes.

#### How do I use the scanning interface?
EVE has a set of tutorial videos to help you figure this out. Press <kbd>F12</kbd> to
open the 'Help' window, then select the 'Tutorial Videos' tab. Scroll down to 'Exploration'
and watch the scanning videos there.

#### Is it better to sell ore directly or reprocess it and sell the minerals?
For new players it is generally better to sell the ore itself, because new players
will not have the level of skills required to efficiently refine ore into the full
value equivalent of minerals.

#### What are the different types of ore and where can I find them?
Cerlestes has an [excellent ore chart](http://ore.cerlestes.de/#site:ore). For even
more detail you can look at the
[UniWiki 'Asteroids and Ore' article](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Asteroids_and_Ore).

#### Why does this asteroid belt not have any asteroids?
Asteroid belts respawn once a day during the daily downtime. In highly-populated systems
individual belts may get mined out quickly - try traveling to another system if all of
the belts in your current system have been mined out, or going to an asteroid anomaly
if there are any listed in the Probe Scanner window.

#### How do I bookmark a point in space rather than a specific thing?
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>B</kbd> to bring up the bookmark creation dialog for your
current position in space.
